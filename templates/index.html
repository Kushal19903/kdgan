    <h1>Knowledge Driven GAN for Text to Image Synthesis</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to KD-GAN, a state-of-the-art text-to-image synthesis system that leverages the power of BERT language model
        and Generative Adversarial Networks to create high-quality images from textual descriptions.

        <h2>BERT Integration</h2>
        <p>
            Our model uses BERT to understand the semantic meaning
            of your text descriptions, enabling more accurate and contextually relevant image generation.

        <h2>Knowledge Driven</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike traditional GANs, our approach incorporates knowledge from pre-trained language models to enhance
            the quality and semantic relevance of generated images.

        <h2>High Quality Results</h2>
        <p>
            The KD-GAN architecture produces high-resolution, detailed images that accurately reflect the input text
            descriptions, with improved visual quality compared to standard text-to-image models.
